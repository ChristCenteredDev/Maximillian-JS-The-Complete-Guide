## Udemy: JavaScript The Complete Guide by Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller

Course: (https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/) <br>
Course length: <b>45 hours</b>

This is the most comprehensive and modern course you can find on JavaScript - it's based on all my JavaScript knowledge AND teaching experience. It's both a complete guide, starting with the core basics of the language, as well as an extensive reference of the JavaScript language and environment, ensuring that both newcomers as well as experienced JavaScript developers get a lot out of this course!
